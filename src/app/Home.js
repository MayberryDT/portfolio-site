    I come from Oklahoma of the United States and I am 
    currently an Assistant Language Teacher in the city 
    of Matsumoto, Japan.
    <br /><br />
    Recently I have decided to improve my web-development 
    skills in order to become a freelance web-developer 
    to fulfill my dream of becoming a location independent 
    entreprenuer so that I can travel the world freely while 
    also creating applications that sound fun.
    <br /><br />
    This website is the first of many web publications 
    to come. I plan on sharing my progress through blog 
    posts, videos, and whatever else seems appropriate. 
    All of which, can be found on this site (if not now, 
    then in the near future).
